Pages are specialized versions of components.  As components, they have a specification, 
embedded components, assets and an HTML template.
</p><p>
Pages do not have parameters, because they are the outermost component in the component 
hierarchy.
</p><p>
All components, however deep their nesting, have a page property that points back to the page 
they are ultimately embedded within.   Pages have an engine property that points to the engine 
they are currently attached to.
</p><p>
Pages participate in a pooling mechanism, so that a single instance of a page component can be 
used by multiple sessions of the same web application.  Even when a large number of client 
sessions are active, it is rare for more than a handful to be actively processing requests in the 
application server.  This pooling mechanism minimizes the number of instances of a page that 
must exist concurrently on the server.  There are some implications to this design that are 
discussed in the following sections.
</p><p>
Pages may have persistent state, properties specific to a particular user
that persist between request cycles.  These properties live only as long as the
<tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt>.  There is some complexity here, because the page state is
entirely <span class="emphasis"><em>seperate</em></span> from any instance of the page.  Remember that
on subsequent requests, a different page from the page pool may be used
to service the request ... in fact, in a clustering environment, the request
may be serviced by an entirely different server.  Tapestry
efficiently and transparently hides these details; when any portion of an application
requests a page, it receives an instance of the page with all persistent page properties
set the the values previously stored for the user.
</p><p>
In fact, any 
component may have persistent state, and use the page as means for recording that state.
</p><p>
The engine is a session persistent object.  The implementation of this varies from application 
server to application server, but the basic idea is that the
<tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt> is serialized after each 
request and stored in a file or database.  It may then be removed from memory.  When a 
subsequent request for the same session arrives, it is restored from the persistent storage.
</p><p>
In a clustering server application, consequtive requests for the same session may be serviced by 
different servers within the cluster.  Serializing and deserializing the
<tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt> is the mechanism 
by which the servers are kept synchronized.  Persistent page properties are stored as part
of the engine, and so they continue to be available, even after the engine has moved
from one server to another.
</p><p>
The visit object is a property of the engine object, so it is serialized and de-serialized with the 
engine.
</p><p>
Pages are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> session persistent.  They exist only within the memory of the Java VM in which they 
are first created.  Pages and components don't need to implement the 
<tt class="classname">java.io.Serializable</tt>
interface; they will never be serialized.
</p><p>
The application engine can always instantiate a new page instance and restore its previously 
recorded state (the recorded state information is serialized with the engine).
