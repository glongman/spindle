<h1>Tapestry Project Nature </h1>
<p>The Tapestry project nature is what makes an Eclipse project a Tapestry project. The project builder, 
  the Spindle wizards and in many cases Spindle editors depend on a project having this nature.</p>
<p>Projects that have the Tapestry nature will appear like this: <img src="images/tap_prj.jpg" alt="http://spindle.sourceforge.net/unstable/images/tap_prj.jpg" width="223" height="16" class="inlineimage"> 
  (note the little "T")</p>
<p>Spindle requires that projects that have the Tapestry nature already have the Java nature (i.e. they 
  are Java projects). Spindle will not allow one to add the Tapestry nature to a project that does not 
  at least have the Java nature.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> that lots of plugins provide thier own project natures. Most do 
  what Spindle does, i.e. add thier nature to a project that already has the Java nature. It is perfectly 
  ok to add the Tapestry nature to a project with any number of other natures; as long as the Java nature 
  is one of them. So it is possible to use, say, the <a href="http://www.sysdeo.com/eclipse/tomcatPlugin.html" class="namedurl">Sysdeo 
  Tomcat</a> plugin and Spindle in the same project (the Tomcat plugin adds its own nature in addition 
  to the Java nature).</p>
<p>So, how does one add the Tapestry nature to a project? There are two answers. First, one can use the 
  "New Tapestry Web Project&quot; Wizard to create your project. Upon completing the wizard the project 
  will be properly configured with the Tapestry nature. The second method requires a bit of preamble...</p>
<p>A Tapestry project requires that the project layout be similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="images/basic_prj_layout.jpg" alt="http://spindle.sourceforge.net/unstable/images/basic_prj_layout.jpg" width="224" height="64" class="inlineimage"></p>
<p>Note there is a folder called "context" that is the root of an exploded war file layout. The context 
  folder is also annotated with the little "T" to indicate its special purpose in this project.</p>
<p class="Note"> 
<ul>
  <li>The folder need not be named "context" or be located anywhere in particular in the project. <em>The 
    restrictions being that the context folder must not be in a java source folder or in the folder designated 
    as the output folder for the java compiler. Also, in the 3.0 and 3.1 versions of Spindle, the project 
    itself can't be the context folder.</em></li>
  <li>The exploded war structure under the context folder must, of course, have a WEB-INF folder containing 
    a web.xml file. The new project wizard will generate a generic web.xml. To customize the web.xml file 
    to use other Tapestry features, consult the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry/doc.html" class="namedurl">Tapestry 
    documentation</a>.</li>
  <li>Also, Spindle requires that web.xml contain a valid J2EE doctype declaration as the Spindle project 
    builder uses a validating XML parser.<em> Exception: Spindle 3.1 allows the use of XML schema by turning 
    off validation of web.xml during a build.</em></li>
  <li>Spindle 3.0 and 3.1 do not allow more than one Tapestry application servlet in a project.</li>
</ul></p>
