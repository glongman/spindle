Tapestry has a very strong sense of what an application is, derived from an 
XML specification file.  This file identifies and gives names to 
all the pages in the application, and identifies certain other key classes as well.  
It also gives a human-readable name to the entire application.
</p><p>
In other systems, there is no application per-se.  There is some kind of  
'home page' (or servlet), which is the first page seen when a client 
connects to the web application.  There are many pages, servlets (or equivalent, 
in other frameworks) and interrelations between them.  There is also some amount 
of state stored on the server, such as the user name and a shopping 
cart (in a typical e-commerce application).  The sum total of these 
elements is the web application.
</p><p>
Tapestry imposes a small set of constraints on the developer, chiefly, that the application 
be organized in terms of pages and components.  These constraints are 
intended to be of minimal impact to the developer, imposing an acceptible amount of 
structure.  They create a common language that can be used between members 
of a team, and even between the technical and creative groups within a team.
</p><p>
Under Tapestry, a page is also very well defined:  It consists of a component 
specification, a corresponding Java class, an HTML template, and a 
set of contained components.
</p><p>
By contrast, when using JavaServer Pages there are one or more servlets, embedded JavaBeans, 
a JSP file and the Java class created from the JSP file.  There isn't 
a standard naming scheme or other way of cleanly identifying the 
various elements.
</p><p>
Interactivity in Tapestry is component based.  If a component is interactive, such as 
an image button with a hyperlink (<tt class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;a&gt;</tt>), clicking on the link 
invokes a method on the component.  All interactivity on a 
page is implemented by components on the page.
</p><p>
JavaServer Pages bases its interactivity on servlets.  Interactive portions of a page must 
build URLs that reference these servlets.  The servlets use a variety of ad-hoc 
methods to identify what operation is to take place when a link is clicked.  Since there 
is no standard for any of this, different developers, even on the same project, 
may take widely varying approaches to implementing similar constructs.
</p><p>
Because pages are components, they have a well-defined interface, which describes to 
both the framework and the developer how the page fits into the overall application.
</p><p>
At the core of any Tapestry application are two objects:  the engine and the visit.  
The engine is created when the first request from a client arrives at the server.  
The engine is responsible for all the mundane tasks in Tapestry, such as managing the request cycle.  
It is sort of a dispatcher, that handles the incoming request and runs the 
process of responding to the request with a new HTML page.
</p><p>
The visit is a second object that contains application-specific data and logic.  
Its type is completely defined by the application.  
In an e-commerce application, the visit might store a shopping cart 
and information about the user (once logged in).
</p><p>
Both the engine and the visit are stored persistently between request cycles, inside the 
<tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt> object.
</p><p>
The engine also provides services.  Services are the bridge between URLs and components.  
Services are used to generate the URLs used by hyperlinks and form submissions.  
They are also responsible for interpreting the same URLs when they are later 
triggered from the client web browser.
