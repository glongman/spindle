Quick dump of my old Eclipse Plugins for the Tapestry Web Framework (will add a README file soon)

**** THIS PROJECT IS DEAD ****

the website http://spindle.sourceforge.net

This project was a suite of Eclipse features and plugins adding IDE support for the Tapestry web framework.
I add no link to that project since support for Tapestry 3.X - itself long dead and replaced by newer, and completely 
incompatible versions (4, 5+).

Also included is the original project for the JettyRunner plugin - handed off to other maintainers around 2005 or 2006.
JettyLauncher itself was replaced by another plugin the name of which escapes me.
