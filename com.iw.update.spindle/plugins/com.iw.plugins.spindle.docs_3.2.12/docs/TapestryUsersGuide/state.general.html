Managing server-side state is one of the most complicated and error-prone aspects of web
application design, and one of the areas where Tapestry provides the most benefit.  Generally
speaking, Tapestry applications which are functional within a single server will be functional within
a cluster with no additional effort.  This doesn't mean planning for clustering, and testing of
clustering, is not necessary; it just means that, when using Tapestry, it is possible to narrow
the design and testing focus.	
</p><p>
The point of server-side state is to ensure that information about the user acquired during the session
is available later in the same session.  The canonical example is an application that requires some form of
login to access some or all of its content; the identify of the user must be collected at some point (in
a login page) and be generally available to other pages.
</p><p>
The other aspect of server-side state concerns failover.  Failover is an aspect of highly-available computing
where the processing of the application is spread across many servers.  A group of servers used
in this way is referred to as a <span class="emphasis"><em>cluster</em></span>.  
Generally speaking (and this may vary significantly between vendor's implementations)
requests from a particular client will be routed to the same server within the cluster.
</p><p>
In the event that the particular server in question fails (crashes unexpectedly, or otherwise brought 
out of service), future requests from the client will be routed to a different, surviving server
within the cluster.  This failover event should occur in such a way that the client is unaware that
anything exceptional has occured with the web application; and this means that any server-side state
gathered by the original server must be available to the backup server.
</p><p>
The main mechanism for handling this using the Java Servlet API is the <tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt>.  The session can store
<span class="emphasis"><em>attributes</em></span>, much like a <tt class="classname">Map</tt>.  Attributes are object values referenced with
a string key.  In the event of a failover, all such attributes are expected to be available on the
new, backup server, to which the client's requests are routed.
</p><p>
Different application servers implement <tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt> replication and failover in different ways; the servlet API
specification is delibrately non-specific on how this implementation should take place.  Tapestry
follows the conventions of the most limited interpretation of the servlet specification; it assumes
that attribute replication only occurs when the <tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt> <tt class="function">setAttribute()</tt>	
method is invoked
<sup>[<a href="#ftn.N10911" name="N10911">5</a>]</sup>.
</p><p>
Attribute replication was envisioned as a way to replicate simple, immutable objects
such as <tt class="classname">String</tt> or <tt class="classname">Integer</tt>.  Attempting to store mutable objects, such as <tt class="classname">List</tt>, <tt class="classname">Map</tt> or some user-defined
class, can be problematic.  For example, modifying an attribute value after it has been stored into the 
<tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt> may cause a failover error.  Effectively, the backup server sees a snapshot of the object
at the time that <tt class="function">setAttribute()</tt> was invoked; any later change to the object's
internal state is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> replicated to the other servers in
the cluster!  This
can result in strange and unpredictable behavior following a failover.
</p><p>
Tapestry attempts to sort out the issues involving server-side state in such a way that they
are invisible to the developer.  Most applications will not need to explicitly access the <tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt> at
all, but may still have significant amounts of server-side state.  The following
sections go into more detail about how Tapestry approaches these issues.
