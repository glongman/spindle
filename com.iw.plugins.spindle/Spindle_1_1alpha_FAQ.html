<h2><a name="1"></a>Why is there a Spindle 1.1alpha Overview</h2>
          There have been changes to Tapestry as it evolved from 2.1 to 2.2.
  Namespaces    and Libraries, Extensions &nbsp;among them. Supporting these
  changes in  a  way that keeps Spindle useful is not a trivial exercise.
It  involves fundamental    changes to the way that users interact with Tapestry
  using Spindle. <br>
<br>
          1.1alpha is the first stab at evolving Spindle to support Tapestry
  2.2   Being  alpha, we don't advertise (and we hope you don't expect) that
  it will  be perfect. In fact we expect it to have many problems from a
useability    standpoint. Spindle 1.1alpha is designed to elicit comment,
we'll explain    the challenges and include in the release what we think
are the solutions.    <br>
<br>
          Frankly the problem is not trivial and the more input the better
 the   end   result will be.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="2"></a>What has changed in Tapestry 2.2 that affects Spindle</h2>
<br>
          First explained are the changes to Tapestry 2.2 that aren't that
 difficult     to explain, or implement. Then we'll get into the hairy stuff.<br>
          This section describes Tapestry concepts like Libraries, Extensions,
   and   Namespaces in very general terms. For precise information about
these<br>
          concepts, we refer you to the Tapestry <a href="http://tapestry.sourceforge.net/doc_frame.html">
         documentation.</a><br>
<br>
          Libraries - Libraries are "bundles" of Tapestry stuff that can
be  shared    between Applications and even between other Libraries. Libraries, 
 unlike   Applications, are non-executable in that they do not have an engine 
 class,   they have no name until one is defined by adding it to an Application.
  They   declare pages, component aliases, have properties, and Extensions
 (see next).   <br>
<br>
          Extensions - Tapestry 2.2 has functionality to declare extensions 
 at  the   Application and Library level. Like an application, or library&nbsp;
   level   Bean that has only one lifecycle, the life of the Application
or   Library.<br>
<br>
          The easy part of supporting the above is modifying the existing 
Application     editor to support Libraries and Extensions, and adding an 
new Library Editor. &nbsp;Also, the Component editor has been    split into 
a Component and a Page editor. Distinctive graphics have been   designed by
the folks at <a href="http://www.romulin.com"> Romulin</a> so that it   is immediately 
obvoius which editor one is looking at.<br>
<br>
          Preliminary versions of the graphics can bee seen <a href="all_screenshot.jpg">
          here</a>.<br>
<br>
         Namespaces - adding a library to an application defines a Namespace
  that   is used to access the resources in that library. For example, say
 we had  a library called CoolComponents.library which contained one component
  , TotallyExcellentGrid.<br>
<br>
         In order to use TotallyExcellentGrid in our application, we delcare
  in  our  .application file a library 'Cool' which refers to CoolComponents.library. 
    'Cool' is now the namespace that tells Tapestry how to find the TotallyExcellentGrid.<br>
<br>
<pre>&lt;application name="MyApplication" engine-class="net.sf.tapestry.engine.SimpleEngine"&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;library id="Cool" specification-path="/cool/package/CoolComponents.library"&gt;<br>
 &lt;/application&gt;
</pre>
        Now to refer to TotallyExcellentGrid in our specifications, we prefiix
   references  to it with the Namespace we have defined &nbsp;(in this case
  'Cool').<br>
<br>
<pre>&lt;component id="DataGrid" type="Cool:TotallyExcellentGrid" /&gt;<br><br></pre>
    Namespaces impact Spindle to a great degree because they are defined
in  the application. That means Spindle must&nbsp; know which application
any  page or component is a member of in order to be able to resolve Namespaces. 
 Tapestry itself does not mandate that components exist in only one application 
 or library. There is also no formal declaration of membership in an application
  or library in the specifications for pages and components. Thus, <i>Spindle
  cannot resolve Namespaces as it was built before 1.1alpha1</i>.<br>
<br>
    The next section describes how Spindle 1.1alpha adresses Namespaces.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="3"></a>How Spindle has changed to support Tapestry 2.2</h2>
    When editing a Tapestry specification, each editor or Spindle feature 
that  must resolve a Namespace needs some context information. That context 
information  is the Application or Library in which the specification (Component 
or Page)  is defined.<br>
<br>
    As has been previously stated, the Tapestry specifications do not give
 Pages  and Components the ability to declare membership in an Application
 or Library.  Spindle 1.1alpha addresses this problem by introducing the
concept  of a Tapestry  Project. A Tapestry project is a 'flavour' of Eclipse's
Java  Project that  is designed to allow Spindle to resolve Namespaces.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="tp"></a>Tapetsry Projects</h3>
    A Tapestry Project is an Eclipse project that knows about an Application
 or Library.  More specifically:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>a Tapestry Application Project knows about an Application</li>
  <li>a Tapestry Library project knows about a Library</li>
</ul>
  Spindle projects are extended&nbsp; Java Projects, so all the Java IDE
functionality  is available to users. <br>
<br>
  These new projects ensure that Spindle functionality that needs to resolve
 Namespaces can always refer to the Project to resolve them. Some restrictions
 apply to Tapestry Projects (see below) . <br>
<br>
    The result is that Spindle 1.1alpha requires that Applications and Libraries
  exist in these projects. Effort has been made to disable all Spindle functionality
  for Tapestry files that exists outside of these new Project flavours. Otherwise
  it will break in numerous and interesting ways. <br>
<br>
    Spindle stores the relationship between a Tapestry Project and its Application
  or Library in a file, stored in the project root, called <tt>.spindle</tt>
    . Normally, one should not edit the <tt>.spindle</tt> file.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="restrict"></a>Restrictions (and reasons for the restrictions)</h3>
  There are some restrictions imposed on users of Tapestry Projects:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>One and only one Application or Library can be associated with a
 Tapestry Project</b>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Pages and Components that exist in a Tapestry Project are assumed
 to be exclusive members of that project's Application or Library</b></li>
</ul>
  If you have a Tapestry Project that is associated with an Application or
 Library, you should not add another Application or Library to that project. 
 If you do, Spindle will ignore it.<br>
<br>
   Its definitely the case that in the past people have built more than one 
 Application that share one or more components. Before Tapestry 2.2 there 
was no concept of a Library of components so this was the only way to share. 
Now that Tapestry *does* have libraries, they should be used to do this sharing.<br>
<br>
  The reason for these restriction revolves around the need for Spindle to
 resolve Namespaces. Without these restrictions Spindle can't to it.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="how"></a>How one can thrive under these restrictions</h3>
  Admittedly, the restrictions imposed above appear to impose a burdon on 
developers. Its is a change from building everything in one project for sure. 
But it is possible to thrive under the rsetrictions and we hope that it will 
become apparent that abiding by these will result in a structure of projects 
that clearly separates Libraries and Applications into more manageable chunks.<br>
<br>
  There are two scenarios that developers will encounter most often:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Bulding Applications using no 3rdParty Libraries or with Libraries
distributed in Jar files.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Building Applications/Libraries that include other libraries that are
 themselves being developed at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<br>
  The first case is simple. If one is not using any 3rdParty libraries, then
 developers will see no difference using the new Spindle.<br>
<br>
  If one is using 3rdParty Libraries that are distributed in Jar files, simply
 add the Jar file to the project build path. That's it, in this case Spindle
 will also work the same as before as the restirctions will not come into
play.<br>
<br>
  In the second case, developing &nbsp;Applications or Libraries that depend
 on other Libraries that are themselves under development in Eclipse is easy
 too. Just add the Tapestry Projects for any dependant Libraires to the build
 path of the Tapestry Project that refers to them!<br>
<br>
  As Pages and Components are assumed to be exclusively owned by the Tapestry
 Project they reside in, one should separate those that were shared before
 into thier own Library. Kinda what libraries are designed for anyways!<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="world"></a>Bringing existing Projects into the new Spindle 1.1alpha
 World.</h2>
<b>S<i>imply installing Spindle 1.1alpha is not sufficent if one already
has Java Projects containing Tapestry stuff</i></b>. Spindle will ignore
Java Projects and all Spindle functionality including the editors will not
work unless your Tapestry stuff is found in a Tapestry Project. <br>
<br>
  Spindle 1.1alpha includes two services to help you turn you existing Projects
 into Tapestry Projects and migrate them to Tapestry 2.2 (if necessary).<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="convert"></a>Converting Projects into Tapestry Projects</h3>
  Its easy to convert existing Java Projects into Tapestry Projects. You
can  even do this if the Java Project does not contain an Application or
Library  (you will be asked to create one).<br>
<br>
  To invoke the conversion utility select, in the Package Explorer, the project.
 Right click on it, choosing Spindle -&gt; Convert to Tapestry Project<br>
<br>
  You will be given options depending on:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>If the Project has one and only one Application or Library there are
 no options, click "Finish" to convert.</li>
  <li>If the Project has more than one Application or Library (choose from
 several), the user will be prompted to select one, click "Finish" to convert.</li>
  <li>If no Application or Library exists in the project, the user will be
 given the choice of creating an Application or Library. After filling out
 the required information for thier choice, users can click "Finish:.</li>
</ul>
  And now you have a Tapestry Project.<br>
<br>
<b>Note: <br>
<br>
 The "choose from several option" is a quick way to convert a project that 
has more than one Application or Library in it. Spindle will ignore</b><b>
   (possibly forever</b><b>) the Apps/Libs not chosen. It is recommended
that  users split those "unchosens" into their own Tapestry Projects. The
best way to do this is to create a new Java Project, move files into it,
and then convert it.</b><br>
<br>
<h3><a name="migrate"></a>Migrating Projects to Tapestry 2.2</h3>
  Tapestry 2.2 introduces a new DTD for specification files. While Tapestry
 and teh Spindle editors are backwards compatible, new features introduced
 in Tapestry 2.2 will not be available unless your files are migrated to
use  the new DTD. <b>Its is recommended that users migrate the specifications
in thier projects to the new DTD for Tapestry 2.2</b><br>
<br>
  Spindle1.1alpha makes this easy by using the Migration Tool.<br>
<br>
  There are some preconditions that need to be meed before the Migration
Tool  will work:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>The Project must be a Tapestry Project (<a href="#convert">convert
first</a> ).</li>
  <li>The Project must have a 2.2 version of the Tapestry jar in its build
 path (net.sf.tapestry.jar).</li>
  <li>The Tapestry specification files must have no parse errors at the time
 Migration is invoked.</li>
  <li>There must only be one Application or Library file in the project and
 than file must be the one known by the project.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
  If any of these preconditions are not met, the Migration Tool will exit 
with an information dialog describing the nature of the problem. Simply fix 
the problem and invoke the Migration Tool again.<br>
<br>
  The Migration Tool has the ability to perform the following functions:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><i>Bump up the DTD version of&nbsp; a specification to Tapestry DTD 
1.3 (required)</i></li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><i>Fix Component References (optional)</i></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>That is, scan the project and find any components/pages using
 hardcoded paths in thier declarations of contained component like:<br>
  <pre>&lt;component id="insertSomething" type="/net/sf/tapestry/components/Insert.jwc"/&gt;</pre>
 These are no longer allowed as of Tapestry 2.2. The Migration tool will
replace the hardcoded path with an appropriate alias, creating one if necessary<br>
  <br>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Change the file extension of pages from '.jwc' to '.page' as required 
by Tapestry 2.2 (optional)</i></li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>If there are .jwc files that the Migration Tool can't determine 
as pages by inference, the Tool will give the option to the user of designating 
which files, if any, should be treated as pages.<br>
    <br>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Add declarations for "lost children" to the Project Application/Library 
(depends on scope)</i></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>If the Migration Tool finds a .jwc (or .page) file<i> in its
scope</i> that is not defined in the Project Application/Library, it will
add such a declaration.<br>
      </blockquote>
      <br>
      <br>
 The Migration Tool also gives the user the ability to limit the scope of 
the Migration (the user can exclude files from consideration).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Note: <br>
      <br>
 When first trying out the Migration Tool, it is recommended that users limit 
the scope of the Migration to a few files so they can get a handle on what 
is going on.<br>
 This is a good idea as there is no "bulk undo" for Migration. You can undo 
the changes on individual&nbsp; files by using the "Replace from Local History" 
feature in Eclipse (consult Eclipse documentation). If you have loaded your 
project into Eclipse from a version control system (like CVS), then you might 
use whatever facility provided (if any) by that system to do the equivalent 
of a "bulk undo".</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Note: <br>
      <br>
 Its ok to run the Migration Tool more than once on a project. If the Tool 
does not detect the need for any one file in its scope to be changed, it will
ignore it.</b><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
 To invoke the Migration Tool, right click on the project, select Spindle-&gt;Migration 
Tool. A wizard will appear. <br>
