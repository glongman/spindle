<h1>Spindle Builder</h1>
<p>TODO - add more</p>
<hr>
<p>Spindle provides a project builder for projects that have the Tapestry Nature.</p>
<p>The builder runs immedaitely after a Java build on the project, locating and validation many Tapestry 
  aspects of the project. More than 50 static errors are identifiable and are marked as error markers 
  on the resources affected. The builder depends on the the project layout adhering to that discussed 
  on the Tapestry Nature page (see link below). If the builder can not run for some reason, an error marker 
  is placed on the project folder with description of the problem.</p>
<p>The value of the builder is that many problems that would result in the Tapestry runtime showing the 
  error page are intercepted before the project is ever deployed to a server.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> not all errors can be caught by the builder. Logic errors that 
  arise because of the runtime state of the application are not caught. So, for example, while the builder 
  can detect if an OGNL expression is not well formed, it can not determine if the expression given might 
  trhow an exception at runtime.</p>
<p>The builder <em>simulates</em> the internal workings of Tapestry by providing it's own implementations 
  of internal Tapestry objects that represent applications, libraries, components, and pages. The underlying 
  mechanisms of Spindle are geared towards development time and no runtime artifacts (like the Servlet 
  spec's context object) are available to the builder. </p>
