Tapestry components are designed for easy re-use.  Most 
components consist of a specification, a Java class and an HTML template.
</p><p>
Some components may need more; they may have additional image 
files, sounds, Flash animations, QuickTime movies or whatever.  These are 
collectively called "assets".  
</p><p>
Assets come in three flavors:  external, context and private.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>An external asset is just a fancy way of packaging a URL at an arbitrary web site.
		</p></li><li><p>A context asset represents a file with a URL 
		relative to the web server containing the Tapestry application.</p></li><li><p>A private asset is a file within the classpath, 
		that is, packaged with the component in a Java Archive (JAR) file.  
		Obviously, such assets are not normally visible to the web server.
		</p></li></ul></div><p>
Components which use assets don't care what flavor they are; they 
simply rely on the method <tt class="function">buildURL()</tt> to provide a 
URL they can incorporate into the HTML they generate.  For example, the 
<a href="../ComponentReference/Image.html" target="_self"><tt class="classname">Image</tt></a> component has an image parameter that is used to 
build the <tt class="varname">src</tt> attribute of an HTML <tt class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;img&gt;</tt> element.
</p><p>
Assets figure prominently into three areas:  reuse, deployment and localization.
</p><p>
Internal and private assets may be localized:  when 
needed, a search occurs for a localized version, relative to a base name 
provided in the component specification.
</p><p>
Private assets simplify both re-use and deployment.  They allow a re-usable Tapestry 
component, even one with associated images, style sheets (or other assets) to be incorporated 
into a Tapestry application without any special consideration.  For example, the standard exception 
page makes use of a private asset to access its stylesheet.
</p><p>
In a traditional web application, private assets would need to be packaged 
separately from the 'component' code and placed into some pre-defined 
directory visible to the web server.
</p><p>
Under Tapestry, the private assets are distributed with the component 
specification, HTML templates and Java code, within a Java Archive (JAR) 
file, or within the <tt class="filename">WEB-INF/classes</tt> directory of a 
Web Application Archive (WAR) file.  The resources are located within the 
running application's classpath.
</p><p>
The Tapestry framework takes care of making the private 
assets visible to the client web browser.  This occurs in 
one of two ways:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The private assets are copied out of the 
				classpath and to a directory visible to the web server.  
				This requires some additional configuration.
			</p></li><li><p>
			The assets are dynamically accessed from the class 
			path using the asset service.
		</p></li></ul></div><p>
Copying assets out of the classpath and onto the web 
site is the best solution for final deployment, since it allows the assets 
to be retrieved as static files, an operation 
most web servers are optimized for.
</p><p>
Dynamically accessing assets requires additional operations in Java code.  
These operations are not nearly as efficient as static 
access.  However, dynamic access is much more convenient during development 
since much less configuration (in this case, copying of assets) is 
necessary before testing the application.
</p><p>
As with many things in Tapestry, the components using assets 
are blind as to how the assets are made visible to the client.
</p><p>
Finally, every component has an <tt class="varname">assets</tt> property that is an 
unmodifiable <tt class="classname">Map</tt>.  The assets in the 
<tt class="classname">Map</tt>
are accessible as if they were properties of the <tt class="classname">Map</tt>.  In 
other words, the property path <tt class="varname">assets.welcome</tt> is valid, if the 
component defines an asset named 'welcome'.
