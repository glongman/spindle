<h1>Running a Project
</h1>
<p>Once your project builds corectly in Eclipse, it is ready to be run.
You have a couple of options for running the project. </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="running_jetty.html">Running using Jetty Launcher</a> 
This is the simplest way, and it allows you to debug your application
in Eclipse!
  </li>
  <li>Manually Deploying
You can deply your app to any servlet container. Just make a .war file
starting from within the content folder.
    <p class="code">cd project/context
jar cvf sample.war *.*
    </p>And then deploy to Tomcat, or any other servlet container,
as you would any .war file.
You may
need to add the Tapestry Libraries to your servlet container or your
.war file, depending on how you want to set things up.
  </li>
  <li>Running Using Tomcat Launcher
    <a href="http://www.sysdeo.com/eclipse/tomcatPlugin.html">http://www.sysdeo.com/eclipse/tomcatPlugin.html</a>
    
I haven't tried the tomcat launcher, but it could work.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend using Jetty Launcher, as it is very easy to use.</p>
