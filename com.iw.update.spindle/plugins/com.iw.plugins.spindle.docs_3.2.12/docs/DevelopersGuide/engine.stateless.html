Through Tapestry release 1.0.0, an <tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt> 
was created on the very first request cycle, and an engine was created and 
stored into it.
</p><p>
This comes at some cost, however.  Creating the session is somewhat expensive if it is
not truly needed, and causes some overhead in a clustering or failover scenario.
In fact, until some real server-side state is created; that is, until a 
persistent page property is recorded or the visit object created, it isn't really
necessary to store any server-side state for a particular client.
</p><p>
Starting with Tapestry release 1.0.1, the framework will operate statelessly 
as long as possible.  When triggered (by the creation of a visit, or by a
persistent page property) an <tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt> will be created and the engine
stored within it and the application will continue to operate pretty much
as it does in Tapestry release 1.0.0.
</p><p>
While the application continues statelessly, the framework makes use of a 
pool of engine instances.  This is more efficient, as it reduces the number of objects
that must be created during the request cycle.   However, the major reason
for running statelessly is to bypass the overhead statefulness imposes
on the application server.
</p><p>
Of course, if rendering the <tt class="classname">Home</tt> page of your application triggers
the creation of the <tt class="classname">HttpSession</tt>
<sup>[<a href="#ftn.N10ACE" name="N10ACE">5</a>]</sup>, then nothing is gained.  A well
designed application will attempt to defer creation of the session so that, at least,
the <tt class="classname">Home</tt> page can be displayed without creating a session.

That is, changes a persistent page property, or forces the creation
of the visit object.
