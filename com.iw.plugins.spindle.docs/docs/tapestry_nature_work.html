<h1>Add/Remove Tapestry Project Nature</h1>
<p>Here's how you add, remove, or modify the <a href="tap_nature.html">Tapestry Project Nature</a> of 
  an Eclipse project.</p>

<p class="Note">Described here is the process for adding the Tapestry nature to a
Java project. I've added notes in the steps below for actions that can
be used to remove or modify the nature of an existing Tapestry project</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Select the project, right click and choose "Properties"</p>
<p><img src="images/nature_select.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="76" ></p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Select "Tapestry" from the list on the left to see the Tapestry project property page.</p>
<p class="Note"><em>Note that in later builds of Spindle 3.1, an option is given here (not shown) to turn on/off the validation of the project web.xml file</em></p>
<p><img src="images/prj_pp_1.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="300" ></p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Check the box marked "is a Tapestry project" to give the project the Tapestry nature.</p>

<p class="Note">Alternately, uncheck the box to remove the nature. <em>This will also clean up any Tapestry specific markers and invalidate the project build state.</em></p>

<p>The button to choose the context folder will enable when the box is checked.</p>
<p><img src="images/prj_pp_2.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="300" ></p>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Click the button to open a folder chooser dialog. You can locate and choose the context folder here. (No image)</p>

<p class="Note">The folder you choose for the context folder must already exist. In Spindle 3.0 there is no way here to create a new folder.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Press "Apply" or "Done".</p>
<p>When finished the nature will be added and a project build will occur immediately.</p>

<p class="Note">If it is detected that the jars required to build a Tapestry project
are missing (in other words the Tapestry distro jars and its
dependencies) you might see this:</p>

<p><img src="images/add_jar_dlg.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="139" border="0" ></p>
<p>Answering "Yes" will cause the <a href="tapestry_frmwk_lib.html" class="named-wiki" title="TapestryFrameworkLibrary">Tapestry 
  Framework Library</a> to be added to the project before the build.</p>

<p class="Note">If you don't want to use the <a href="tapestry_frmwk_lib.html" class="named-wiki" title="TapestryFrameworkLibrary">Tapestry 
  Framework Library</a> (for example, you want to put the Tapestry jars directly in the WEB-INF/lib folder). 
  Answer "No". <em>The subsequent build will be broken until you actually add the jars to the classpath</em>.</p>

<p>That's it. These are the steps needed to add, remove, or modify the Tapestry nature of an Eclipse project.</p>
