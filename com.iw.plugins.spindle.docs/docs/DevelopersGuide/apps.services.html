Tapestry applications will need to define new engine services when a page 
must be referenced from outside the Tapestry application
</p><p>
This is best explained by example.  It is 
reasonable in an e-commerce system that there is a particular page that shows 
product information for a particular product.  This information includes 
description, price, availability, user 
reviews, etc.  A user may want to bookmark that 
page and return to it on a later session.
</p><p>
Tapestry doesn't normally allow this; the page may be bookmarked, but 
when the bookmark is triggered, the page may not render correctly, because it 
will not know which product to display.  The URLs normally generated in a 
Tapestry application are very context sensitive; they are only meaningful in 
terms of the user's navigation throughout the application, starting with the Home page.  
When bookmarked, that context is lost.
</p><p>
By defining a new engine service, the necessary context can be encoded directly 
into the URL, in a way similar to how the direct action works.  This is
partially a step backwards towards typical servlet or JSP development, but 
even here Tapestry offers superior services.  In the e-commerce example, 
the service URL could encode some form of product identifier.
</p><p>
An example of this is in the Virtual Library application.  In 
order to make certain pages bookmarkable, a new service named 
"external" was created.
</p><p>
The external service includes the name of a page and the primary key 
of an object that page displays (this was simplified by the 
design of the Vlib entity beans, which always use  an <tt class="classname">Integer</tt> 
as the primary key).
</p><p>
The external service works much the same was as the page service, except 
that it invokes an additional method on the page, <tt class="function">setup()</tt>, 
which is passed the primary key extracted from the URL.
</p><p>
The end result is that when a user arrives at such a page, 
the URL used identifies the page and the primary key.  Bookmarking the page stores the URL so 
that when the bookmark is later opened, the correct data 
is read and displayed.
